# EveningTestPassOffice


Pass office example 
In its work, the pass office uses a list containing the following information about employees:

Pass number
Name of the employee
Type of pass (regular, urgent, transit)
Date of issuance of the pass
I. Create a class library that implements the features:

1. Adding an employee's pass to the list
2. Deleting an employee's pass from the list
3. Date of the last pass issued (as a property) 
4. Counting the number of passes issued in a given date interval (Start date - End date)

II. Create a console application in which the list of passes is initialized and functions 3, 4 are called.

The implementation language is c#. It is not necessary to design a database.
